# Probabilistic-Backpropagation

The code in this section was taken from https://github.com/HIPS/Probabilistic-Backpropagation.

The section of the code we have taken from is from the repo in the original paper
(no code has been implemented with more recent technology).

Minor adjustments are made to be compatible with modern Python
and to fit with the format of our experiments.
