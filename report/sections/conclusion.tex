\section{Conclusion}
In this report, we summarize the technical details of SVGD. 

If we have more time, we would consider more baselines and datasets for Bayesian logistic regression. One baseline is Doubly Stochastic Variational Inference (DSVI) proposed by \cite{ref_dsvi}. The original implementation is for MATLAB, and current attempt to reproduce it in Python is at debugging stage. Experiments with DSVI shows constant test accuracy despite of the gradient descent, suggesting the implementation has some problems.
