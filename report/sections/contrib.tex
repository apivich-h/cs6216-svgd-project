\section{Individual Contributions}
All team members contributed to the writing of the report and poster. Besides those, reproduction and experiments were assigned to different members, namely:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Apivich Hemachandra: } Ran small-scale Bayesian logistic regression experiments and the Bayesian neural network experiments
    \item \textbf{Jiashu Tao:} Bayesian logisitic regression on binary Covertype dataset using SVGD, SGLD and DVSI.
    \item \textbf{Bo Wang:} Implement Gaussian Mixture in NumPyro (Part of figure 1) and reproduce figure 2 (MC vs SVGD). Do timing experiments about number of particles.
    \item \textbf{Jiayuan Ye:} Add suport for negative log likelihood of Gaussian mixture in the paper authors' code \url{https://github.com/dilinwang820/Stein-Variational-Gradient-Descent}, reproduce and expand figure 1. 
\end{itemize}
