We reproduce the Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) algorithm proposed by Liu et al [1]. Similar to gradient descent, SVGD is a variational inference algorithm that iterative optimizes a set of particles to match a distribution by applying functional gradient descent. In this project, we reproduce the algorithm with the help of some publicly available code bases and verify the experimental results in the paper.
