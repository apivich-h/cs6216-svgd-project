    \caption{Comparison of accuracy (left) and log-likelihood (right) obtained by NUTS and SVGD algorithm on small-scale logistic regression dataset. The dotted line represents the situation where both algorithms perform as well was each other, and each point represent the average result on one of the dataset.}
